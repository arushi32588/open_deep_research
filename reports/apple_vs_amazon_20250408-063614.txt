Apple's primary focus is long-term hardware and software ecosystem integration, which includes products such as iPhones, iOS, macOS, and Apple Watch. Their software development is a methodical, exhaustive process, with a heavy emphasis on pre-release testing to ensure polished performance and a tight user-centric design. The tools they use for product development and testing include Xcode, XCTest, Instruments, and Appium.

Amazon, on the other hand, concentrates on a diverse range of sectors including E-commerce, Cloud services (AWS), and devices like Alexa and Fire. Agile strategies dominate their approach, which enables rapid deployment and scalability, especially for web services and massive backend systems. Their product development involves continuous and high-frequency testing, utilizing technologies like Selenium, JUnit, PyTest, AWS Device Farm, and custom CI/CD pipelines to bring new innovations to the market quickly.

3. Market Positions

Apple's market position is secured by its robust hardware-software ecosystem, enabling them to deliver high-quality products with excellent design and user experience. 

Amazon's diverse business model also gives it a strong market position. Besides its dominance in E-commerce, Amazon's venture into cloud services (AWS) and a range of devices positions them as an innovative technology leader.
